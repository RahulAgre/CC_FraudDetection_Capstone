Capstone Project - Credit Card Fraud Detection

# Problem Statement
The problem statement chosen for this project is to predict fraudulent credit card transactions with the help of machine learning models.

In this project, you will analyse customer-level data which has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group.

The dataset is taken from the Kaggle website and it has a total of 2,84,807 transactions, out of which 492 are fraudulent. Since the dataset is highly imbalanced, so it needs to be handled before model building.



# Business Problem Overview
For many banks, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. Banking fraud, however, poses a significant threat to this goal for different banks. In terms of substantial financial losses, trust and credibility, this is a concerning issue to both banks and customers alike.

It has been estimated by Nilson report that by 2020 the banking frauds would account to $30 billion worldwide. With the rise in digital payment channels, the number of fraudulent transactions is also increasing with new and different ways.

In the banking industry, credit card fraud detection using machine learning is not just a trend but a necessity for them to put proactive monitoring and fraud prevention mechanisms in place. Machine learning is helping these institutions to reduce time-consuming manual reviews, costly chargebacks and fees, and denials of legitimate transactions.
